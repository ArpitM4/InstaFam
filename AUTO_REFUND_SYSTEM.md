# Auto-Refund System for InstaFam

## Overview

The auto-refund system automatically processes vault requests that remain unfulfilled for more than 30 days. It provides:

- **Automatic refunds** to fans when creators don't fulfill requests within 30 days
- **Status tracking** with "Unfulfilled" status for expired requests  
- **Point transaction history** with refund records
- **Creator dashboard** with expired requests tab
- **Fan protection** ensuring guaranteed service or money back

## How It Works

### 1. **Request Lifecycle**
```
Fan Redeems â†’ Pending (30 days) â†’ Auto-Expired â†’ Refunded
```

### 2. **Automatic Processing**
- Runs daily to check for requests older than 30 days
- Changes status from "Pending" to "Unfulfilled"
- Refunds FamPoints to the fan's account
- Creates refund transaction record
- Adds expiry timestamp

### 3. **User Experience**
- **Fans**: See "Unfulfilled" status in /my-fam-points, receive automatic refund
- **Creators**: See expired requests in separate "Expired Requests" tab

## API Endpoints

### Manual Processing
```http
POST /api/admin/process-expired-redemptions
```
Processes all expired redemptions and returns summary.

### Automated Cron Job
```http
GET /api/cron/auto-refund
```
Calls the processing endpoint automatically (can be scheduled).

### Fetch Expired Requests
```http
GET /api/redemptions/expired
```
Returns expired redemptions for the authenticated creator.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
The system updates these models:
- `Redemption`: Added "Unfulfilled" status and `expiredAt` field
- `PointTransaction`: Added "Refund" type and `redemptionId` field

### 2. **Scheduling Options**

#### Option A: Manual Execution
```bash
node scripts/process-expired-redemptions.js
```

#### Option B: Cron Job (Recommended)
Add to your server's crontab to run daily at 2 AM:
```bash
0 2 * * * curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/cron/auto-refund
```

#### Option C: Vercel Cron (for deployed apps)
Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/auto-refund",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Environment Variables**
Make sure your app has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your production URL
```

## User Interface Changes

### Creator Dashboard (`/dashboard/requests`)
- **New Tab**: "Expired Requests" showing unfulfilled redemptions
- **Visual Indicators**: Orange badges and borders for expired items
- **Information Display**: Shows original request date and expiry date

### Fan Points Page (`/my-fam-points`)
- **Status Updates**: "Unfulfilled" status for expired requests with red styling
- **Refund Records**: Shows "Refund" transactions in point history

## Monitoring & Logs

The system provides comprehensive logging:
```javascript
// Console output example
ðŸ”„ Starting expired redemption processing...
Found 3 expired redemptions to process
Processed refund for redemption abc123: 50 points to @username
âœ… Auto-refund processing completed: 3 redemptions processed
```

## Testing

### Test Expired Redemptions
1. Create a test redemption
2. Manually set `redeemedAt` to 31+ days ago in database
3. Run the processing script
4. Verify refund appears in fan's account and transaction history

### Test UI Components
1. Check creator dashboard shows expired requests tab
2. Verify fan sees "Unfulfilled" status in redemptions
3. Confirm refund transactions appear in point history

## Benefits

### For Fans
- âœ… Guaranteed refund after 30 days
- âœ… Clear status tracking
- âœ… Automatic process, no manual claims needed

### For Creators  
- âœ… Clear visibility of expired requests
- âœ… Motivation to fulfill requests promptly
- âœ… Separate tracking doesn't clutter active requests

### For Platform
- âœ… Builds user trust and confidence
- âœ… Ensures service quality standards
- âœ… Automated process reduces support burden

## Customization

### Change Expiry Period
Update the days calculation in `/api/admin/process-expired-redemptions/route.js`:
```javascript
// Change from 30 to desired number of days
thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30);
```

### Custom Refund Logic
Modify the processing logic to add:
- Partial refunds
- Creator penalties  
- Email notifications
- Different expiry periods for different item types

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated users can access their own redemptions
- Admin endpoints should be protected with proper authentication
- Cron endpoints should validate requests or use secure tokens
- All database operations use proper error handling

## Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring
- Check logs for processing errors
- Monitor refund transaction volumes  
- Review expired request patterns
- Ensure cron job is running correctly

### Database Cleanup
Consider archiving very old expired redemptions to maintain performance.

## Support

For issues or questions about the auto-refund system:
1. Check the console logs for error details
2. Verify database connectivity and schema updates
3. Test the manual processing script first
4. Ensure all API endpoints are accessible
