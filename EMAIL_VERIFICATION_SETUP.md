# Email Verification Setup Guide

## 🎉 Email Verification Implementation Complete!

Your InstaFam application now has a complete email verification system using NextAuth.js EmailProvider. Here's what has been implemented:

### ✅ What's Been Done

1. **User Schema Updated**: Added `emailVerified` field to support NextAuth
2. **NextAuth Configuration**: Added EmailProvider with MongoDB adapter
3. **Dependencies Installed**: `@auth/mongodb-adapter`, `nodemailer`
4. **Signup Form Redesigned**: Now email-only with magic link flow
5. **Verification Page**: Complete UI for email verification instructions
6. **Environment Variables**: Email server configuration template added

### 🔧 Setup Required

You need to configure your email server credentials in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Current configuration (update these values):
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=465
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email@gmail.com        # ← Change this
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password # ← Change this
EMAIL_FROM=InstaFam <noreply@instafam.social>
```

### 📧 Gmail Setup (Recommended for Development)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Create an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate an app password for "Mail"
3. **Update your `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-16-digit-app-password
   ```

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **User visits `/signup`** → Enters email → Clicks "Send Magic Link"
2. **NextAuth sends email** → User receives verification link
3. **User clicks link** → Automatically signed in → Redirected to dashboard
4. **Account created** → `emailVerified` field set in database

### 🎯 New User Flow

```
/signup → Enter Email → Email Sent → Check Inbox → Click Link → Dashboard
```

### 🔄 Testing the Flow

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/signup`
3. Enter a valid email address
4. Check your email for the verification link
5. Click the link to complete signup

### 📝 Files Modified

- `models/User.js` - Added emailVerified field
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` - Added EmailProvider
- `app/signup/page.js` - Redesigned for email-only signup  
- `app/auth/verify-request/page.js` - New verification page

### 🛡️ Security Benefits

- **No password storage** - More secure than traditional signup
